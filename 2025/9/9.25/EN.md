{Why did I} choose to study computer science? Perhaps(/pɚˈhæps/) {it was} just a whim.
The main reason (|) was a programmer I met at the subway station.
He was fixing the ticket gates, performing operations (|) I couldn’t understand on a screen.
To me, it looked really cool, and (|) I {wanted to} figure out what he was doing.
So I set a goal for myself — to at least understand what he was writing, {even if} I didn’t become a programmer myself.
Eventually, based on my own understanding, I chose Software Technology (|) as my major in college.
But from {what I can} tell now, that programmer’s work was probably closer to embedded systems rather than software.
