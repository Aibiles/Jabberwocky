Why(~)am I so eager (^) to compete(/kəmˈpiːt/)?
Ever since(/sɪns/) starting university, I've(~)wanted to give competitions(/ˌkɑːm.pəˈtɪʃ.ən/) a try.
It(~)was all about skipping(/skɪp/) classes, about ranking, about securing(/səˈkjʊr/) direct admission (^) to the undergraduate program.
Some say you can learn more from competitions than from lectures — I can’t(/kænt/)(~)say I(~)agree.
Not(~)that(`) you learn nothing, but the efficiency is low. 
And what(~)you really gain are interpersonal skills.
Besides, competitions take up too much time.
My longest preparation(/ˌprep.əˈreɪ.ʃən/) period(/ˈpɪr.i.əd/) ran from October to May the next year, all just to secure that undergraduate admission spot.
How ridiculous.
