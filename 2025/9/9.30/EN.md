If you can manage(~)to study for (!)half an hour (^) every day, congratulations — that’s 900 minutes wasted in a month.
Studying just 30 minutes a day (^) is far from sufficient.
To truly master a skill, you need at(~)least three hours daily — and the maximum depends on your condition.
If you want(~)to keep learning, then keep going.
It’s not about making up for yesterday’s laziness(/ˈleɪ.zi.nəs/), nor about (!)easing your conscience(/ˈkɑːn.ʃəns/) for slacking(/slæk/) off tomorrow.
It’s(~)simply because you need to (!)master this(~)skill — to reach your goals.
