I hate scattered moments.
Things like fragmented learning or broken-up entertainment don’t work for me.
I’m slow-minded—I can’t switch gears on and off like a machine.
That’s why I started skipping classes regularly since my first year in college.
It’s like mixing mud: I just jumble time together roughly.
But most courses take attendance, so I have to keep staring at my phone to not miss a check-in, and sometimes rush over last minute.
When it’s like that, there’s no point in skipping—time just slips through my fingers like sand, blown away by the wind.
I don’t want that.
