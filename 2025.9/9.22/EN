Thanks to my elders' efforts, I’ve received my green card —— everything happened so fast.
It might sound inappropriate, but compared to the past, I finally see a glimmer of hope.
I plan to improve my English to a conversational level within the next six months.
Starting today, I’ll write a short passage daily, use AI to translate it into English, and practice reading it aloud.
The content will include reflections on my three years in vocational college and 
some personal experiences —— along with whatever random thoughts come to mind.
Stay tuned.
