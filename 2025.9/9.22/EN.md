Thanks to my elders' efforts, I’ve received(/rɪˈsiːvd/) my green card —— everything happened  (^)so fast.
It might sound inappropriate, but compared to the past, I finally see a glimmer(/ˈɡlɪm.ɚ/) of hope.
I plan to improve my English to a conversational level within the next six months(/mʌnθ/).
Starting today, I’ll write a short passage daily, use AI to translate it into English, and practice reading it aloud.
The content will include reflections on my (^)three years (|) in vocational college and some personal experiences(/ɪkˈspɪr.i.əns/) —— along(/əˈlɑːŋ/) with whatever random thoughts come to mind.
Stay tuned(/tuːnd/).
