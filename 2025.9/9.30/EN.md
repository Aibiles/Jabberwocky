If you can manage to study for half an hour every day, congratulations — that’s 900 minutes wasted in a month.
Studying just 30 minutes a day is far from sufficient.
To truly master a skill, you need at least three hours daily — and the maximum depends on your condition.
If you want to keep learning, then keep going.
It’s not about making up for yesterday’s laziness, nor about easing your conscience for slacking off tomorrow.
It’s simply because you need to master this skill — to reach your goals.
