I've always been good at imitation. Since I was a child.
I picked up everything quickly compared to those around me — from martial(/ˈmɑːr.ʃəl/) arts and the recorder to sketching(/sketʃ/), and now programming.
I stopped practicing martial arts (^) after the community center (^) I frequented (^) closed down.
I learned the recorder only because it was required for the exam(/ɪɡˈzæm/).
As for sketching(/sketʃ/), I gave it up voluntarily(/vɑː.lən.ter.əl.i/).
After outlining the basic shapes, I didn’t know how to proceed — how to render(/ˈren.dɚ/) shadows, soften edges, and more importantly, I lost sight of why I was learning it in the first place.
So I quit.
