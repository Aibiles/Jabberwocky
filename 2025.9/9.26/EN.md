I've always been good at imitation. Since I was a child.
I picked up everything quickly compared to those around me — from martial arts and the recorder to sketching, and now programming.
I stopped practicing martial arts after the community center I frequented closed down.
I learned the recorder only because it was required for exams.
As for sketching, I gave it up voluntarily. After outlining the basic shapes, I didn’t know how to proceed — how to render shadows, soften edges, and more importantly, I lost sight of why I was learning it in the first place.
So I quit.
